/* I had already solved this problem in typescript before.
    It was through this problem that I realized the difference between C and JavaScript.
    In JavaScript, the solution with the best time complexity for the problem is actually the worst in practice,
    while the best-performing solution relies on built-in functions that may have a higher time complexityâ€”but one that runs in C.
    My advice in JavaScript master built-in functions.

    My solutions
        - Typescript: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/submissions/1511440804/
            Time complexity: O(n)
            Space complexity: O(n)

        - Rust: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/submissions/1589355422/
            Time complexity: O(n)
            Space complexity: O(1)
